No two InCollege members are the same—and it’s that diversity which makes our community so great. 
We believe in inclusion, and we want you to know that whatever your goals, ideas and abilities are, 
we’re here to help you succeed. We’re on a journey to make accessibility and inclusive design part of our core principles, building accessibility from the ground up and testing our products with assistive technology to make sure that everyone can use InCollege to advance their professional goals.
